 <h1>Animation</h1>
 <hr style="width:100%;">
 <p style="font-size:130%;">Animation is an art form with the ability to tell a
story and convey a multitude of emotions along with information. Animation
can be found almost everywhere in media from commercials, to movies, to
games. Every single animation need an animator or a team of animators to
create it. There are many kinds of animation: 2D, 3D, motion graphics, visual
effects. Each of these categories may have multiple people working on them
using their own special skills to produce the final product. The reason for
researching this occupation is because of my fascination and respect for the
craft. I admire the art of storytelling immensely and the creativity that goes
into it. Skills and Qualities The skills an animator possesses are integral to the
work they do. Without their skills, they are out of a job. For 3D animators,
they must learn the modeling software used by the company who is hiring them. Using the correct software is key because in a team must be able to
easily transition a project from person to person without hassle. Some of the
most common software used in the 3D industry are Autodesk Maya, Cinema
4D, Houdini, Photoshop, and After Effects (“3D Animation Careers: Job
Description & Salary Information”). Keeping up to date with new technology is
vital. Other skills also attractive to an employer, involve proficiency in Adobe
products, being able to code, drawing skills, and communication skills (Flavin).
Having a base knowledge of many software is a safe bet in the industry.</p>
